I have made progress on the programming front.  I went ahead and followed a tutorial showing how to make a screen capture program in python using open cv.
I also installed homebrew on my mac to download python, pip, and git then went ahead to try and learn how to use git threw terminal commands on mac.  
This did not work out so well, but I want to learn because I see the benefits from doing it through terminal over GitHub desktop which I have set up to use right now.
I also realised that the IDE that I am using, VScode, runs commands through my computers terminal and how handy that is rather than haveing to switch back and forth.
