Game clip capture software Senior Project
This is my Senior Capstone Project.
The inspiration behind this is because I am an avid gamer and wanted to see what went into a program like  this, because I have used some of the existing programs that aren't documented thoroughly.
I used skills I have learned from my CS classes, for example working with OpenCV, an AI library, and some APIs.
